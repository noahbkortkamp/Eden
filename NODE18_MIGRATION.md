  - [x] Confirmed no need for stream/web polyfills
  - [x] Confirmed native support for os.availableParallelism

- [x] Created Clean Runner Scripts
  - [x] iOS simulator runner without polyfills
  - [x] Expo Go runner without polyfills

- [x] Documentation
  - [x] Updated README.md with Node.js 18 requirements
  - [x] Added NVM setup instructions
  - [x] Documented new scripts and tools

## Benefits of Node.js 18

1. **Native Support for Modern APIs**
   - Web Streams API is natively available
   - os.availableParallelism is natively supported
   - No need for polyfills that added complexity

2. **Better Compatibility with Expo SDK 53**
   - Aligned with Expo's recommended Node.js version
   - Reduced errors and warnings during build and runtime

3. **Improved Development Experience**
   - Cleaner codebase without workarounds
   - Simplified dependency management
   - Better error messages and stack traces

4. **Future-Proofing**
   - Prepares for future Expo and React Native updates
   - Follows modern JavaScript ecosystem best practices

## Testing Verification

The following tests have been run to verify compatibility:

```bash
# Verify Node.js compatibility with built-in modules
npm run test:node

# Verify Metro bundler configuration works correctly
npm run test:metro

# Test environment verification script
./scripts/check-environment.sh
```

## Running with Node.js 18

To use this project with Node.js 18:

1. Install Node.js 18 if you haven't already:
   ```
   nvm install 18
   ```

2. In the project directory, switch to Node.js 18:
   ```
   nvm use
   ```

3. Clean install dependencies:
   ```
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

4. Use the new scripts to run the app:
   ```
   # For iOS simulator
   ./scripts/run-ios-clean.sh
   
   # For Expo Go
   ./scripts/run-expo-go-clean.sh
   ```
