# Expo SDK 53 Upgrade - Progress and Notes

## Summary of Changes

We've successfully reverted to a stable version of the app (the "Find Friends button" commit) and created a dedicated branch `sdk-53-upgrade` for implementation of the upgrade to Expo SDK 53.

### Fixes Implemented

1. **Authentication Context Fix**:
   - Removed duplicate auth context file (`app/context/auth.tsx`) that was conflicting with the main `AuthContext.tsx`
   - This fixed the "useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider" error

2. **Node.js Polyfills Configuration**:
   - Enhanced `metro.config.js` with more comprehensive Node.js module resolution
   - Updated `babel.config.js` with additional module aliases for Node.js core modules
   - Ensured proper loading of the custom polyfills implementation from `app/utils/node-polyfills.js`
   - Explicitly imported the polyfills in `_layout.tsx` to ensure they're available throughout the app

3. **Package Dependencies**:
   - Updated `@types/react`, `jest-expo`, and `typescript` packages to versions compatible with Expo SDK 53
   - Fixed dependency issues with `internal-ip` package

### Current Status

- The app now successfully starts up without errors related to:
  - SDK version mismatch (we're now properly on SDK 53)
  - Node.js module resolution (crypto, stream, util)
  - Authentication context

## Future Steps and Recommendations

1. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Test all app features thoroughly to ensure the fixes resolved all issues
   - Pay special attention to any features that use authentication, Node.js modules, or networking

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Review the custom polyfills implementation to ensure it's as lightweight as possible
   - Consider using more specialized polyfills where needed

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Regularly update dependencies to their latest compatible versions
   - Consider using a tool like Renovate or Dependabot to automate this process

4. **Version Control**:
   - Keep the original branch as a stable reference point
   - Create a new branch for any additional upgrades (such as to SDK 54 when it becomes available)

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update the main project README with information about the upgrade and any special considerations
   - Document any dependencies or environment requirements
